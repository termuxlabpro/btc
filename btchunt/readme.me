💣 T.L.P Bitcoin Private Key Scanner

Welcome to Termux Lab Pro's educational tool for exploring Bitcoin private keys and address formats!

⚙️ What This Script Does

This script runs endlessly to generate random Bitcoin private keys, derive all major types of Bitcoin addresses from them, check balances in real-time, and log any "hit" (non-zero balance) to a local text file.

🔧 Features

✅ Real Private Key Generation

Securely generates a 64-character hexadecimal Bitcoin private key.

Converts the private key into:

Uncompressed WIF

✅ Full Address Derivation

From one private key, the script derives all major Bitcoin address types:

Legacy (Uncompressed): 1...

Legacy (Compressed): 1...

P2SH (Compatibility SegWit): 3...

Bech32 (Native SegWit): bc1...

✅ Real-Time Balance Checking

Uses blockchain.info API to check each address's BTC balance.

Displays balances clearly and color-coded.

✅ Infinite Auto Scanning Loop

Keeps scanning private keys automatically.

Never stops unless the user interrupts the process.

✅ Save Positive Results

When any address has a balance, the script saves the following into found_keys.txt:

Private key

WIF keys

All derived addresses

Balance of each address
